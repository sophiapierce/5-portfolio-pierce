                                This year I was a part of the Andover High School Girls Volleyball Program (AHSGV). I was on the freshman team and I played starting setter. I absolutely loved my team and I definitely felt that my skills and mental game both improved during the regular season. I can’t wait until next year and I strongly believe that being part of this program has and will push me to be stronger and work harder.

                            <p>This year is my first year being a member of the Evolution or EVO Club Volleyball program. Last year I participated in the Merrimack Valley Juniors Volleyball team and I enjoyed it but I felt I would be better challenged at EVO. For evo and I am on 15 power which is the highest level team that I could make for my age group that does not participate in tournaments in other countries and states. I am currently playing outside hitter for this team.

                                In the 7th grade we took a trip to a leadership camp in maine. I had a lot of fun and was asked to return to the camp in 8th grade due to my leadership skills. Only four kids from each school that went to that camp were asked back to participate in their allstar program. I had a great time met a bunch of new people and was able to better my facilitation skills and come up with ideas to make a difference in my community.

                            <p>Hear at the highschool there are many awesome opportunities to get involved, one of them being clubs. This year I chose to participate In Team Cure club. IN this club we fundraise to make care packages to give to kids that have been diagnosed with diseases including cancer. We also make cards, videos, and save up for experiences to put smiles on the faces of children who fight for their lives on a daily basis. It is a very fulfilling experience and I hope to continue my participation in this club during the rest of my highschool career

                                I am a strong believer that family is the most important thing in a person's life. I would definitely not be where I am in life without my family. Even though things get a little bit crazy I love them to death and I can't thank them enough for what the have done for me. My parents are two of the most hardworking people I know and I am so grateful for all the work they put in to provide a good life for me and my siblings. I have loved being able to see my brothers grow to where they are now and I can't wait to see the people that they will turn out to be. My sister is an amazing person who has always been kind to everyone she's met and I am so proud of the work she has put in to play the level of both soccer and gymnastics that she does.
